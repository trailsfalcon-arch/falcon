/**
 * Tour packages — the "spoke" pages in our hub-and-spoke SEO model, and the
 * highest-intent surface on the site. Every one carries a day-by-day
 * itinerary, honest inclusions/exclusions and FAQs, because thin price-list
 * pages do not rank and do not convert.
 *
 * The eleven packages, their prices, day-by-day text and FAQs are the same
 * ones the Google Ads landers at go.falcontrails.in sell (that site's
 * build/pages.js), so a traveller never sees two versions of one trip.
 *
 * Prices are per-person on twin-sharing, the convention every Indian traveller
 * already expects. They are starting points, not quotes.

That is why our first 48 hours are deliberately low-effort and why we never drive to Pangong early in a trip.

For Nubra, Pangong, Hanle, Tso Moriri and Umling La we pay the Ladakh environmental fee and the daily wildlife fee, and the receipt is with you before you arrive. Foreign nationals need a Protected Area Permit for those areas, which we arrange. Leh town and the Sham Valley need neither. We only need a scan of your photo ID at booking."

May and June are the busiest and most photogenic for snow-lined passes. July and August are warmest but can see rain-related roadblocks. From November to March most high roads close."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "q": "Is the Manali–Leh highway safe?",
        "a": "It is a well-travelled route from roughly late May to mid-October, and our drivers run it weekly through the season. The road crosses five passes above 4,000 m, so we break the journey at Jispa and Sarchu rather than pushing through in a single day — that pacing is the biggest safety factor there is."
      },
      {
        "q": "How bad is the altitude, honestly?",
        "a": "Leh sits at 3,500 m and roughly one traveller in four feels mild breathlessness or a headache on day one. That is why our first 48 hours are deliberately low-effort and why we never drive to Pangong early in a trip. Every vehicle carries oxygen and an oximeter, and your driver is trained to recognise AMS. If you have a cardiac or pulmonary condition, speak to your doctor and then to us."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do I need permits, and do you arrange them?",
        "a": "Indian travellers do not need an Inner Line Permit. For Nubra, Pangong, Hanle, Tso Moriri and Umling La we pay the Ladakh environmental fee and the daily wildlife fee, and the receipt is with you before you arrive. Foreign nationals need a Protected Area Permit for those areas, which we arrange. Leh town and the Sham Valley need neither. We only need a scan of your photo ID at booking."
      },
      {
        "q": "What kind of hotels do you use?",
        "a": "Leh stays are 3★ or 4★ depending on the package, always centrally located. At Nubra, Pangong and Sarchu we use deluxe or Swiss camps with attached bathrooms, heating and hot water — the only sensible option at that altitude. All rates are quoted on twin-sharing; single occupancy is available on request."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can the itinerary be changed?",
        "a": "Every route on this page is a starting point. Add Turtuk, drop Pangong, extend Hanle, swap camps for hotels, travel with a toddler or a ninety-year-old — we build around it. Roughly two-thirds of our bookings end up as fully custom itineraries."
      },
      {
        "q": "How does payment work? Is EMI available?",
        "a": "A 25% deposit confirms your dates and locks your stays; the balance is due seven days before arrival. We accept UPI, bank transfer and all major cards, and offer no-cost EMI on cards for three, six and nine months. You receive an itemised quote showing exactly what each night and each vehicle costs — never a single lump sum."
