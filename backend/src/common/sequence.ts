/**
 * Race-safe sequential number generator ("FT-B-2026-0001" style).
 *
 * The read-then-write pattern (find highest, add one, insert) races when two
 * requests fire simultaneously — both read N, both write N+1, one commit
 * fails with a unique-violation. That fires on New Year's Day when the year
 * prefix flips and the counter resets to 1 for multiple concurrent quotes.
 *
 * This helper retries on Prisma's P2002 up to `maxRetries` times, so a
 * collision loses at most a few milliseconds. Beyond that, the caller sees
 * the exception (which itself signals contention worth investigating).
 *
 * Using a Postgres sequence would be even cleaner, but sequences don't
 * partition by prefix (we want "FT-ITI-2026-*" to be independent from
 * "FT-B-2026-*"). A retry loop is the simpler, correct-enough answer.
